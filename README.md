# PasteBin-Botnet
A DDoS script in NodeJS that uses pastebin as a command and control server for DDoS attacks

## Installing to a server
Because of how we made the script it is super easy to run on any server with NodeJS all you need to do is run it and it should install its needed packages, After installing it may crash and you might have to run it again but after that its done! *Make sure to edit the "YOUR_PASTEBIN_LINK" to be the raw URL to your pastebin/rentry link. As an example https://pastebin.com/raw/AYPgKsE6 or https://rentry.org/y3rbq/raw and thats it!

## [Setting up your pastebin](https://github.com/OddDevelopment/PasteBin-Botnet/wiki/Setting-up-your-command-and-control-server-on-rentry)
Click the link for instructions on that.

### Todo list:
- [ ] Edit speed from command and control site.
- [ ] Change check speed from command and control site.
- [ ] Stop all servers running your command and control site.
- [ ] More options for request types (GET, POST etc.).
- [ ] Get 10 stars.

### Disclaimer
This was just made as a proof of concept because I though it would be funny to use a paste site as a command and control server please do not use for any real attacks without permission! Remeber DDoS attacks break the law and breaking the law is bad, Don't do it ;).
